<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started
Using it on your local machine
### Prerequisites
You need to have Node, yarn and npm installed on your machine. To check if they are installed, open up a terminal window and type the following:
 ```sh
npm -v
yarn -v
node -v
   ```
   
If these commands print out a version number in the terminal, you are good to go. If not, you need to go ahead and install what is missing. For the purpose of this project, I used [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo on your local machine
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Mar-Issah/File-Metadata-Microservice-FCC.git
   ```
2. Change directory into the new folder and type the following, this installs the required dependencies
    ```sh
    npm install
   ```
3. To run the React project.
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
